The original footer on this site was just a dark strip with a few links. It worked, but it did not really say anything about whose site this is. The goal was to turn the bottom of the page into something a bit more intentional: not just a place for links, but a small signature that says “this was built by Devollox.”

The new footer sits on a dark background, aligned to the same content width and separated by a thin border line. Inside, it is split into two simple blocks: brand on the left, external links on the right. This keeps the structure clean and avoids the usual overloaded multi‑column footer pattern.

The brand block is a small badge with the Ⓓ mark, the Devollox name, and a short tagline. The badge has a subtle outline and a soft glow, which adds a neon‑like accent without turning the footer into a light show. In light and dark themes it keeps the same shape, but adjusts glow and text contrast so it feels at home in both.

On the right there is a row of text links: Steam, GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Reddit. They are styled as calm, lowercase text instead of buttons: secondary color, gentle hover state with a tiny lift. That way the footer stays light, and those external profiles feel like part of the personal brand rather than a block of social icons.

On the home page the footer uses a slightly different, lighter shade of dark, which creates a soft “platform” at the end of the layout instead of a hard cut to black. In the end, the bottom of the site is no longer just boilerplate — it behaves like a quiet, persistent signature that closes every page with the same voice.
