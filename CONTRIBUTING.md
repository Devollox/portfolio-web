## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially around UX polish, accessibility, performance and new small experiments.

If you want to contribute:

1. **Fork** this repository and create a new branch:
   - `feat/your-feature-name` or `fix/your-bug-description`.

2. **Run the project locally** to reproduce or test:
   - `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`
   - `npm run dev`

3. **Open a clear PR**:
   - Describe what you changed and why.
   - Add screenshots or GIFs for UI / UX changes.
   - Mention any new env variables or config.

### Good first contribution ideas

- Improve wording / copy on pages (About, Uses, Signature).
- Add small accessibility fixes (focus states, aria labels, keyboard nav).
- Polish animations or layout issues on mobile.
- New “micro‑experiments” for the Developer / Signature / Uses pages.

Please keep the overall style minimal and experimental — this is a personal lab, not a corporate template.
